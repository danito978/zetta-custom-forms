When adding code, don't leave comments for every function, do not have more than one return (JSX) in a single file and do not leave console logs after debugging is done.

When creating an interface or type, create a file in /src/types and export it to your component

Use ShadCN when possible.

Do not use "any" as a type.

Do not use functions name().. use modern ecmascript ways of creating a functions with const
